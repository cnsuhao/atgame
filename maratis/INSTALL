Building
========

Maratis uses CMake to configure and generate build files. Builds must be made 
outside of the source tree.


Mac OS X
--------

To generate an Xcode project for building Maratis, peform the following steps
to create a build directory outside of the source tree:

  mkdir Build
  cd Build
  cmake -G Xcode ../Maratis

Assuming the Maratis source directory resides in the same top directory.


Windows
-------

To generate a Microsoft Visual Studio project for building Maratis, perform 
the following steps to create a build directory outside of the source tree:

  mkdir Build
  cd Build
  cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ../Maratis

Assuming the Maratis source directory resides in the same top directory.


Linux
-----

To generate Makefiles for building Maratis, perform the following steps to 
create a build directory outside of the source tree:

  mkdir Build
  cd Build
  cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../Maratis
  make
  make install

Assuming the Maratis source directory resides in the same top directory.


Installation
------------

The installation location is dependant on the build platform. E.g. it defaults 
to /usr/local on Linux and c:/Program Files on Windows.

To override it and install Maratis locally you have to set the install prefix 
when running CMake to generate the build files:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/ ../Maratis

This will install the Editor, Player and SDK in a directory called Maratis 
located in your home directory.
